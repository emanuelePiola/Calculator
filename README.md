# 📂 Calculator by Emanuele Piola
## Project realised in class with Professor Cambieri & Professor Belliardo
The goal of **Calculator** is producing a clone of the Windows' calculator app.

To realise this project we will use C# coding program on Visual Studio 2022 (or 2019).

<br>

### The main steps for the realisation of this project are:
* **Form creation with dinamic generation of buttons**, in a way that the result'd be the most similar possible to the windows calculator's one.
    * Use of a `struct` implemented with the characteristics of the button.
    * Use of symbols the most similar possible to the windows calculator's one.
* **Button management on click**, with different implementations for each type of symbols on the buttons.
    * Use of an `enum` to categorize the different symbols (number, operator, backspace ecc..).
    * Use of a `switch` to select the category to implement.
* **Output organization**, with label Result management.
    * Font management, text size implementation.
* Operator & particular (special) **Operator implementation** as a real calculator.
    * Operations conducted between the number in input or the result foud, as the user want.
* **Management of history of operations made**, with visualization on its label.
    * Representation of the operations that are in progress or of the process that reaches a result.
    * Use of multiple controls to make it as similar as possible to the windows calculator's one.

From this program we will start to use the Git app as a memory from which we can take and edit the projects wherever we are. 
<br>
 This will replace the USB flash drive, that could easily be lost or corrupted.
